- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Roman. I like to solve problems in the industry and academia with data engineering and data science. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working as a Data Scientist in the Data & AI team at Ergon in Zurich.
- ðŸŒ± My learning areas are DevOps for data pipelines and machine learning workflows.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on promoting software engineering best practices in science, because I believe that these are the missing piece to making research reproducible and impactful again. With [Engineers for Science](https://www.engineersforscience.com/), I am connected researchers with software engineers and sharing my learnings.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data related roles, research stays, code reviews, and physics.
